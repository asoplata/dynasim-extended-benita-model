% # iHVA_PYdr_JB12:
%
% High-threshold Calcium current, Hodgkin-Huxley-style, for generic pyramidal
% dendrite compartments used in the DynaSim implementation of (Benita et al.,
% 2012). Note that this is called "iCa" in the original paper.

% Parameters
gHVA = 0.43 % mS/cm^2
EHVA = 120  % mV

% Functions
Minf(X) = 1./(1 + exp(-(X+20)./9))

% Note: For why the current term was not made negative, see below.
IHVA_PYdr_JB12(X) = gHVA.*Minf(X).^2.*(X-EHVA)

% Interface
% Note: Usually in DynaSim, the current is made negative
% before being assigned to a linker, but in this case, the
% below is less confusing since exposing IHVA_PYdr_JB12 for the
% CaBuffer_PYdr_JB12 mechanism requires a not-made-negative
% version of IHVA_PYdr_JB12.
@current += -IHVA_PYdr_JB12(X)
@IHVA_PYdr_JB12 += IHVA_PYdr_JB12(X)
