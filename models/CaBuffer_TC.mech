% Parameters
tauR = 5         % ms
Ca_inf = 0.00024 % mM of calcium, aka 2.4e-4
D = 2            % unitless conversion factor, unclear purpose
% See "Interneuron-mediated inhibition synchronizes neuronal activity during
%     slow oscillation" Chen et al., 2012, Equation 5:
A = 10/(2*96489) % mM cm^2/(ms uA) drive conversion of Ca-modifying currents
CaBufferIC = 0.000001
CaBufferNoiseIC = 0.0001

% ODEs
% In original code, the CaBuffer requires input only from IT_TC, but it used by
%     IT_TC and Ih_TC. Specifically, "iT" seems to be a locally-defined
%     variable (defined by IT_TC) for each TC cell that is fed into CaBufferICa at
%     currents.cpp line 1047. In other words, the CaBuffer relies on IT_TC
%     only.
CaBuffer_TC' = max(-A.*@IT_TC./D, 0) + (Ca_inf - CaBuffer_TC)./tauR
CaBuffer_TC(0) = CaBufferIC+CaBufferNoiseIC.*rand(1,Npop)

% Interface
@CaBuffer_TC += CaBuffer_TC
